# React & TypeScript - The Practical Guide

This repository contains code attachments for our [React & TypeScript - The Practical Guide](https://acad.link/react-ts) course.

## What's Included?

- [/code](/code/) contains code snapshots which you can use to compare your code to mine
- [/attachments](/attachments/) contains lecture-specific attachments (i.e., they are attached directly to a lecture in the course)
- [/examples](/examples/) contains further React & TypeScript examples which you might find helpful

## How To Use The Code Snapshots

The code snapshots in the [/code](/code/) folder are meant to help you compare your code to mine in case you're following along with the course and you're facing some error.

By taking a look at my code and comparing it to yours, you should be able to figure out what's wrong in your code and what might be causing the error you're facing.

## What's The Idea Behind The Extra Examples?

The main goal of the course is to get you started with React & TypeScript, and to introduce you to the most important concepts which you'll likely need in most or all of your React & TypeScript projects.

But, of course, there's an endless amount of components you might need to build in a given project or problems you might face in certain situations. The [/examples](/examples/) folder therefore contains further React + TypeScript examples that might come in handy in certain situations.

It's by no means a complete collection or anything like that - it's simply an extensions of the course.
